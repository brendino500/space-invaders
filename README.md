# 👾 Space Invaders

## ☄️ Overview

- This is my first paired project coded in Pixi.js and TypeScript with Adam Regan.

- After an intense coding bootcamp I didn't want to stop coding, **so set myself a challenge to learn TypeScript and Pixi.js**. This is my first project in Pixi.js and my second in TypeScript.

- As the bootcamp was incredibly fast paced, I realised that I had almost completely forgotten fundamentals and I wanted to code another project which focuses on game logic, rather than implementing a large framework like React.
