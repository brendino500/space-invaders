# 👾 Space Invaders

## ☄️ Overview

![Demo](https://i.ibb.co/XxgR9c5/spaceinvaders.png)

- This is my first paired project coded in **Pixi.js and TypeScript** with Adam Regan.

- After an intense coding bootcamp I didn't want to stop coding, **so set myself a challenge to learn TypeScript and Pixi.js**. This is my first project in Pixi.js and my second in TypeScript.

- As the bootcamp was incredibly fast paced, I realised that I had almost completely forgotten fundamentals and I wanted to code another project which focuses on game logic, rather than implementing a large framework like React.

## 🖨 Technologies and Tools

- TypeScript
- Pixi.js
- Tween.js

## 🎮 Game instructions

- **Enter** to start the game
- ➡️ Move right
- ⬅️ Move left
- **Space Bar** to shoot

## 💭 Process

![First Draft](https://twitter.com/i/status/1330808034143166468)

- The first step was to create the canvas and add the sprites to it gradually.
- After each sprite was added, the basic animation was created.
- The game logic was made first and the styling was added at the end.

## 🩹 Challenges

- TypeScript

## 🎉 Things I'd learnt

- **At each step of the way, we had the Pixi and Tween documentation open on a browser and that taught me to always check on documentation.**
- Seeing a **professional developer debug code was so interesting** to watch as I learnt about the **different ways of debugging and the logical process on how to approach it**.

## 🎙 Comments

- I really enjoyed pair coding this with someone who has been in the industry for 10 years as **seeing different approaches and best practices** has made me rethink about my past code and how it could be improved.
